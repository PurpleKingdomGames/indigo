/** A `Pipeline` is very similar to a `SignalFunction` but for shader programs.
  *
  * It is simply a function that maps a `Shader[Env, A]` to a `Shader[Env, A]`, conviently disguised a simple `A => B`.
  * So far, it's exactly a Functor that is weirdly outside of `Shader`, and it is true that you do not need Pipelines to
  * write shaders. What `Pipeline`s give you is nice transformation syntax. If you've ever see a visual shader editor -
  * it's a bit like that.
