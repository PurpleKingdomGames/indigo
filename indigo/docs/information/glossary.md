# Glossary

## A

### Automata

A type of subsystem used to manage simple autonomous particles.

## B

## C

## D

### Dice

A pseudo-random number generator seeded on the current frames running time to facilitate testing and issue reproduction.

## E

### Entry point

The main interface an Indigo game developer is exposed to when trying to write a game. It is a user friendly game template that constructs the Frame Processor that Indigo needs to run your game, and starts the game engine.

### Event

A description of an action that is emitted during a frame and made available to the subsequent frame, such as a keyboard event.

## F

### Frame Independence

Movement that is adjusted to account for the time elapsed between frames in order to proceed at a consistent rate.

## G

### GameTime

A sample of the current time provided to every frame. All computations are assumed to happen instantly at the time given.

## H

## I

### InputState

The current state of input devices like the keyboard, mouse or game pad.

## J

## K

## L

## M

## N

## O

### Outcome

Used to gather state and events that were the result of a frame update.

## P

## Q

## R

### Referential Transparency

The ability to reliably replace a function call and arguments, with the result type and observe no change.

## S

### Scene

A part of your game that represents a particular stage like a screen or a level.

### Scene Update Fragment

A piece of the final scene to be presented that can be combined with other pieces to form the final scene.

### Shader

A pair of small programs written in GLSL (a C-like language) comprised of a vertex program that tells a graphics card where to place an entity on the screen, and a fragment program that specifies what color to draw each pixel.

### Signal

A function that produces a value for given time. Used in procedural animation.

### Signal Function

A combinator used to manipulate, process, and compose Signals.

### SubSystem

A small, well encapsulated game that can be combined with the main game. Used to organise sections of you game and to manages tasks and processes in the background.

## T

### Time Varying Value

A value that is updated automatically based on some behavior and the time delta between frames.

## U

## V

## W

## X

## Y

## Z
