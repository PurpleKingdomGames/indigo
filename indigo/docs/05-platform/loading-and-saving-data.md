# Loading & Saving Data

Sooner or later, you're probably going to need to load data into your game or save user data.

### Dealing with save games

When you think of loading and saving, probably the first thing that comes to mind is save games.

Currently Indigo's local storage options are a bit limited, but what you can do is [storage events](/03-gameloop/events.md#storageevents).

Storage events use your browsers local storage, which you can think of like a key value store. You process might be:

1. Organise save data into a case class
2. Convert the data to JSON
3. Fire off a `Save("save game 1", json)` event to stash it away against a key.
4. Then to reload, fire a `Load("save game 1")` event.
5. Eventually (normally 1 frame later) you'll get a `Loaded(json)` event.
6. Deserialise the JSON into your case class and apply it to your model.

### Loading local data

You can always load data in plain text format (that could be JSON or CSV for example), by using making use of the [asset loading](/05-platform/assets.md#asset-loading) functionality. This allows you to dynamically load a data file at any time, process it, and apply it to you model.

### Loading and saving over a network

The other way to load and save data might be over a network, please see the [networking page for details](/05-platform/networking.md).

Similar to the save game flow, you might do something like:

1. Organise save data into a case class
2. Convert the data to JSON
3. Fire off a `POST` event to send it to a server over HTTP.
4. Then to reload, fire a `GET` event.
5. Eventually you'll get a `HttpResponse` event.
6. Deserialise the body of the response into your case class and apply it to your model.
