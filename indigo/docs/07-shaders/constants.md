# Shader Constants, Variables, and Outputs

Below are tables of shader constants and variables that are available to you, provided by Indigo, when writing shaders for the WebGL 2.0 renderer.

To clarify terminology use on this page:

1. "Constants" are fixed values that never change.
1. "Variables" are values that you should treat as read only, and that will change between program runs.
1. "Outputs" are values that you may be able to read, and may wish to write to in order to affect the final rendering.

## Common

These values are available to all shader programs.

### Constants

Name | Type | Description
---|---|---
`PI`|`float`|`3.141592653589793` or 180 degrees.
`PI_2`|`float`|`PI / 2` or 90 degrees.
`PI_4`|`float`|`PI / 4` or 45 degrees.
`TAU`|`float`|`2.0 * PI` or 360 degrees.
`TAU_2`|`float`|`PI` or 180 degrees.
`TAU_4`|`float`|`PI / 2` or 90 degrees.
`TAU_8`|`float`|`PI / 4` or 45 degrees.

## Vertex Shader Programs

> Note that `SIZE` and `UV` are treated differently between entity and blend shaders, this may be revised in the future.
