This release contains two seemingly small bug fixes / corrections that could significantly change the look of your game. As luck would have it, they have been around for several versions and have gone unnoticed until the day _after_ the previous release.

- Loaded images are now correctly unpacked with premultiplied alpha.
- Shape fill colours have had premultiplication removed.
