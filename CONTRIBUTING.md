# Contributing guidelines

All efforts to contribute to Indigo are welcome and encouraged, as the project can only be better with more eyes looking for problems and more minds trying to solve them.

All contributions must be inline with our code of conduct.

Ways to contribute:

## Reporting issues

Think you've found a problem? We'd like to hear about it!

How to report via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/issues):

> Please raise ONE TICKET PER ISSUE.

1. Try and search for similar issues currently open.
2. If you can't find an issue, raise a new one.
3. Please try to describe a minimal scenario that reproduces the issue.

## Updating documentation

Game engines are complicated, especially for new people, and so are only as good as their documentation. If you like to help update our docs, please raise a Pull Request against the [documentation website repo](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-docs).

## Writing code for Indigo

Indigo is complicated and the main authors have a roadmap for it's direction. Having said that, we do want people to feel empowered to join in!

Please conside the follow:

1. Only fix one thing at a time.
2. Small, easy to digest, minimal change Pull Requests are the easiest to merge.
3. Discuss, discuss, discuss. The bigger the change, the more critical it is to tell us what you're up to.

> If you submit a huge, difficult to process Pull Request without having discussed it with the maintainers, we are under no obligation to accept your work.

### Minor improvements

Correcting a misleading comment? Spotted a couple of lines that look off? Adding tests to existing code without changing the code itself? Please go right ahead and raise a PR.

### Larger changes

Please raise an issue on the project, explain what you intend to do and indicate that you'd like to work on the fix.

## Donations and sponsorship

Contributions are based on time or money, and building and maintaining Indigo requires both. If you'd like to help cover our costs, help pay for development or just buy us a cup of coffee, we'll be very grateful.

Please look for the sponsorship button on the [indigo github repository](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo).
