            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davesmith00000/roguelike-tutorial/main/part3/roguelike-part3_2.gif" alt="&quot;A early screenshot of a roguelike made with Indigo&quot;"></p>
<p><strong>This is a brief post-mortem of my attempt to do the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o5x585/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/">&quot;RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial&quot;</a> in Scala.</strong></p>
<p>I've been asked on several occasions if it would be possible to build a roguelike using Indigo?</p>
<p>My answer has always been that it should be possible, but that it would probably be challenging because Indigo isn't built for rendering lots of text.</p>
<p>About a month before this year's annual &quot;RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial&quot; I was asked again, and decided it was time to find out if it really was possible or not!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/refractions.png" alt="&quot;pixel art being refracted through a normal map to give the illusion of a lens.&quot;"></p>
<p>Thought I’d try a different format this time to see if I can make it easier to write these things. Hopefully it will encourage me to do it more often. Aiming for a sort of agile / stand-up / update format.</p>

<p>Next version is coming along nicely, lots of new exciting stuff going into it. The only technical hurdle ahead of me is to reimplement dynamic lighting, and hopefully make it better! After that I’ll begin prepping the next release.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The current work in progress is to re-think Indigo’s rendering pipeline. This isn’t the first time I’ve gone back to the drawing board, but it is the first time since Indigo’s launch. Since this is going to mean a bit of a longer wait between releases than usual, I thought I ought to explain what’s happening and report on my progress so far..</p>
